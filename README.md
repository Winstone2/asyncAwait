# asyncAwait
Explanation and Thought Process:

    The wait function returns a Promise that resolves after a specified timeout using setTimeout. This function is useful for implementing the exponential backoff between retries.

    The requestWithRetry function attempts to make an HTTP request to the specified URL and retries up to MAX_RETRIES times if an error occurs.

    In the loop, it tries to make the HTTP request using the request function (which you should implement with your actual HTTP request logic). If the request succeeds, it returns the response immediately.

    If the request fails (throws an error), it calculates the timeout for the current retry using exponential backoff (doubling the previous timeout).

    It logs the waiting time and then waits using the wait function.

    After the wait, it logs that a retry is happening with the error message and the current retry count (i).

    The loop continues until the request succeeds or until MAX_RETRIES are exhausted. If MAX_RETRIES are exceeded, it throws an error (you can customize this behavior as needed).

    In the usage example, we call requestWithRetry and handle the success or failure of the request accordingly.

This code implements a common pattern for handling retries in scenarios where network requests might fail temporarily. It increases the wait time between retries to avoid overloading the server and improves the chances of a successful request in unreliable network conditions.
